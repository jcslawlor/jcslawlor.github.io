My name is Joseph, but you can call me Joe! Nice to meet you. I just graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in Information Technology and another degree in English. I am currently looking for entry level roles in cybersecurity analysis and data analysis, or other related roles. I am also looking for roles in technical writing, and could be the freelancer you're looking for. Blog contains writing samples. Please reach out with any opportunities!
